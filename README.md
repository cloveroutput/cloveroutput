Hi
  <br>
  I'm a college student who is obssessed with coding, games, and anything computer related.
  <br>
  My main objective in life is to work at a cool IT/Tech company, and life comfortably.
  <br>
  I'm (kinda) good with Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Working on learning C++ and TypeScript.
  <br>
  To top it off, I'm generally a very funny person. So there's that.
